# Smart-Infrastructure-and-Cost-optimization
## Overview
Welcome to Smart Infrastructure and Cost Optimization â€“ a powerful platform designed to address the complexities of cloud service pricing while ensuring efficient deployment and optimal cloud resource management. By integrating DevOps practices, this project helps you to automate application deployment and gain real-time insights into cloud cost analysis, offering a smarter way to manage your cloud infrastructure on AWS EC2.

## Features
* Real-time Cost Analysis: Get an in-depth, real-time view of your cloud service expenses to ensure you're optimizing every dollar spent on cloud resources.
* Automated Deployment: Leverage GitHub Actions and Docker to automate application deployment, ensuring seamless integration and delivery.
* Scalable Architecture: Designed to scale effortlessly with your cloud usage, optimizing for cost and performance on AWS EC2.
* Cloud Cost Management: Implement tools and strategies to help you track, monitor, and reduce cloud service costs effectively.
* DevOps Automation: Automated workflows using GitHub Actions, bringing efficiency and consistency to your development and deployment process.
  
## Tech Stack
* Cloud Platform: AWS EC2
* CI/CD Tools: GitHub Actions
* Containerization: Docker
* Cloud Cost Management: Real-time cost analytics tools
* DevOps Tools: Terraform, Ansible (optional depending on setup)
* Programming Language: Python (for cost management scripting) and other backend technologies as required
* Deployment Strategy: Docker-based container deployment
  
## Ensure you have the following installed and configured:
* AWS CLI: For accessing AWS services and managing EC2 instances.
* Docker: For containerizing the application.
* GitHub Actions: For automating CI/CD workflows.
* Terraform or Ansible (optional): For infrastructure as code (IaC) to provision resources automatically.
* Node.js / Python (depending on project setup): For running your backend services.
* GitHub Account: To manage your repository and GitHub Actions workflows.

## CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
### This project leverages GitHub Actions to automate the deployment and testing process. The pipeline ensures continuous integration and continuous delivery by automating:
* Build: Every time you push code to GitHub, GitHub Actions will trigger a build of your application.
* Test: Tests are run as part of the build process to ensure the stability and functionality of the app.
* Deploy: Once the build passes successfully, the application is deployed to the AWS EC2 instance via Docker.
